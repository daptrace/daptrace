This repository contains the source code of Daptrace, which is presented by
Middleware'19 Industrial track[1].


Usage
=====

1. Clone it on your system running the Linux kernel v5.0 or later
2. Ensure that the debugfs is mounted at /sys/kernel/debug
3. Go into the cloned repository, and execute 'sudo ./daptrace.py -h'

'daptrace.py' is the wrapper script for record of the data access pattern.  For
visualization of the recorded access pattern, please take a look into the
'scripts/' directory.


A Successor of Daptrace
=======================

A new open-source project based on Daptrace, called DAMON, is ongoing.  The
goal is to fulfill production quality and more features.  One main additional
feature of DAMON is automation of monitoring based memory management
optimization, namely DAMON-based Operation Schemes (DAMOS).  The source code is
periodically released to LKML.  It has also introduced by an LWN article[2].
The latest version (as of 2020-04-18) of DAMON source code is available at
https://github.com/sjp38/linux/releases/tag/damos/rfc/v6
